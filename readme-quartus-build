project creation and compilation

  create a quartus 16.1 fpga project

  name the top-level logic name to pyblz_top


  add 
    top-level two .v files: 
        pyblz_top.v
        SysTop.v
    and the pll file
        de0nano_50m_altpll.qip

  take out these pll files out from the  project
        de0nano_50m_altpll.v
        de0nano_50m_altpll_bb.v
        de0nano_50m_altpll_inst.v

  assign device to ep4ce22f17c6

  import pin assgnment from 
        pyblz_top_assignments.csv

  change clock50 assignment from pin r8 to e1 as r8 is not a clock pin!



result:

        total logic elements:    1392/6272(22%)
        total registers:          576
        total memory bits        134144/276480(45%)
